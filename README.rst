Features
--------

- **Absolute time** - Esaily insert note and event at any time point.

.. code:: python
    
    # Add C4 on beat 8.
    clip += Note('C4', location=8)


- **Time slicing** - Modify notes for a specific time period.

.. code:: python
    
    # Raise notes from beats 8 to 16 by 4 semitones.
    clip[8:16] += 4

- **Generator** - Functions to generate music clip quickly.

.. code:: python

    # Generate chord progression with sheet.
    progression = sheet('C4:M7 A4:m9 | F4:M7 G4:7')

- **Effects** - Functions to process MIDI.

.. code:: python

    # Add delay effect to clip.
    delay(clip, n=3, length=0.5, decay=0.9)
